# Minimalist Journal

## Core Principles
- Simple, minimal, distraction-free
- Privacy-first: offline, no sync, no tracking
- Notes are local, with backup & restore
- Works as a PWA: install on your device like an app

## Features & How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser or install as PWA
2. Click a date or "New Entry" to write
3. Edit, delete (with confirmation), or toggle CAPS
4. Backup/restore notes anytime to keep them safe
